# PyTorch_Tensors
## A Pytorch Tensor is basically the same as a NumPy array. This means it does not know anything about deep learning or computational graphs or gradients and is just a generic n-dimensional array to be used for arbitrary numeric computation. However, the biggest difference between a NumPy array and a PyTorch Tensor is that a PyTorch Tensor can run on either CPU or GPU
